# Secret_Code_Generator
The **Secret Code Generator** is a Python program that encodes and decodes messages using a Caesar cipher. Users input a message and shift number to shift letters in the alphabet, while non-letter characters are ignored. It supports both encoding and decoding.
The **Secret Code Generator** is a Python project designed to encode and decode messages using the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique. The program allows users to input a message and a shift number to shift the letters in the message by a specified amount. This creates an encoded message where each letter is replaced by another letter a certain number of positions forward in the alphabet. The cipher also supports decoding, allowing users to reverse the process and recover the original message by shifting letters back by the same number.

The program features a user-friendly menu that lets the user choose between encoding a message, decoding a message, or exiting the application. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while ignoring non-letter characters like spaces and punctuation, ensuring smooth text manipulation.

Core functions are modular and reusable, with `encode_message()` handling the encoding process and `decode_message()` performing the decoding. The program also manages edge cases, such as wrapping around the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'Z' by 2 results in 'B') and handling invalid input. The project demonstrates practical use of Python functions, loops, string manipulation, and user input handling, making it a great exercise in fundamental programming concepts.
